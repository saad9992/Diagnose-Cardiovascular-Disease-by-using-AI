 Diagnose Cardiovascular Disease using AI (Expert System)

‚ù§Ô∏è Diagnose Cardiovascular Disease using AI (Expert System)
üìå Overview
This AI-based healthcare project involves developing an expert system for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and recommending appropriate treatment plans based on patient symptoms and risk factors. The system uses classic Artificial Intelligence reasoning techniques ‚Äî specifically Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining ‚Äî to infer possible conditions and provide recommendations, simulating the decision-making process of a human medical expert.

The goal is to assist medical practitioners and patients in early detection of cardiovascular risks and suggest initial treatment advice for proactive care.

üß† How the Expert System Works
The system is built around a knowledge base of cardiovascular symptoms, risk factors, and treatments, and a reasoning engine that applies inference rules to draw conclusions based on user input.

Key AI techniques:

Forward Chaining (Data-Driven Reasoning):
Starts with known patient symptoms and iteratively applies rules to arrive at possible diagnoses and recommendations.

Backward Chaining (Goal-Driven Reasoning):
Starts with a potential diagnosis and works backwards to check if the patient‚Äôs symptoms and risk factors satisfy the conditions for that diagnosis.

ü©∫ Knowledge Base
The system‚Äôs knowledge base includes:

Symptoms:

Chest pain

Shortness of breath

Irregular heartbeat

Fatigue

Dizziness

Risk Factors:

Age

Smoking

High blood pressure

High cholesterol

Diabetes

Family history of CVD

Possible Diagnoses:

Coronary Artery Disease

Hypertension

Arrhythmia

Heart Failure

Treatment Suggestions:

Medication options

Lifestyle changes

Surgical interventions (if critical)

Follow-up tests and monitoring

Rules:
Logical IF-THEN rules mapping combinations of symptoms and risk factors to possible diagnoses and treatment plans.

Example:

scss

Edit
IF (chest pain AND shortness of breath AND high blood pressure)
THEN (possible diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease)
AND (recommend: ECG test, Beta-blockers, reduce salt intake)
üìä System Features
Interactive User Interface:
Asks users about their symptoms and medical history via a simple form or command-line input.

Reasoning Engine:

Applies forward chaining to analyze user data and suggest possible conditions.

Uses backward chaining to verify diagnoses against the knowledge base.

Treatment Recommendation:
Provides tailored advice based on detected conditions and risk severity.

Explanation Facility:
Shows reasoning steps and which rules were fired for transparency.

üì¶ Project Workflow
Define the knowledge base:
List symptoms, risk factors, diagnoses, treatments, and inference rules.

Develop the reasoning engine:
Implement forward chaining and backward chaining algorithms.

Design the user interface:
Simple CLI or GUI where users enter symptoms and risk details.

Generate recommendations:
The system infers possible diseases and suggests treatment.

Display explanation:
Trace fired rules and reasoning path.
